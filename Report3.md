## Major Changes
Professor Murphy did not receive any new CLEM data. Therefore, it is our best interest right now to focus on just the light-transmitted microscope images. In addition, we decided to design our model similar to the previous model using Adversarial Autoencoders instead of Conditional Adversarial Network. This approach allows the model to predict images even when some of the features are missing. 
## Accomplishments
We determined that the previous model developed by the Allen Institute isn’t really invertible, and it is therefore, in our best interest to develop a new model. The rough outline of our neural network architecture has been determined. I am currently in the process of implementing the first part of the model in PyTorch. 
## Meeting Milestones
We successfully determined that the existing model is not invertible and have started implementing our model. We were unsuccessful in obtaining CLEM data. 
## Surprises
There were no surprises.
